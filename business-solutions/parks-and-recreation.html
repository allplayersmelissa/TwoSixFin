<h3>Community Parks and Recreation</h3>

<p>Making enrollment and registration easier on members increases participation and therefore increases department revenue.</p>
<p>Community sports and recreation departments are vital to the community they serve. These services are often run by the city or municipality and a part of the local government, which needs to have the most up-to-date solutions at the best price available. TwoSix provides services and solutions that allow these departments to run efficiently without the need for high-dollar consultants for setup and financial management. </p>
<p>Rather than requiring members to come in to, or call the facility to enroll or pay their fees, parks and recreation departments can easily collect these fees and payments online, making enrollment faster and easier on members and therefore  saving time and effort on department employees. </p>

<h6>Enrollment and Membership Fees</h6>
<p>Membership often drives the success of these family focused organizations, and enabling members to easily pay their membership fees ensures faster collections and better accounting. By accepting membership fees online or in the facility, you allow your members to easily keep up to date on their membership at their convenience. </p>

<h6>Smooth Registrations</h6>
<p>When you accept registration payments immediately online, you not only provide a convenience for those registering, but your department has an accurate report of confirmed registrations and have the information you need to plan accordingly. </p>

<h6>Equipment/Uniform Orders</h6>
<p>Many team sports require teammates to purchase their own equipment and uniforms. Often has been the case where the sports director or coach is expected to organize the order,collect the money, write a check to cover the cost of it all - and cross his or her fingers it all works out.</p>
<p>By allowing these orders to be placed online, you mitigate the headache of asking a coach or sports director to manage the process by streamlining orders, payment, and verification. </p>

<h6>Payroll Options</h6>
<p>With the utilization of Debit Card Payroll feature, local parks and recreation departments can pay their personnel quickly and easily on re-loadable debit cards. This a great solution for:</p>
