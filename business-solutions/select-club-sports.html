<h3> Select / Club Sports Leagues and Teams</h3>


<p>Select and club sports are expanding across the nation for youth and adult sports alike. These highly competitive  teams and organizations are businesses â€“ made possible by the registration fees, tournament fees, and club dues.  Select and club sports organizations need to be able to efficiently accept these fees from their players, attendees, participants and boosters in order to maintain efficient operations.</p>
<p>TwoSix Financial provides the best solution for these dynamic, on-the-go organizations. Registration and participant fees are accepted online through credit and debit cards, checks can be accepted and validated right away, and an accurate accounting report is always up to date.</p>
<!--<p>Additionally, these select and club teams can pay their coaches, judges, referees, umpires and other personnel with the Debit Card Payment option. Automatically issue payment to these employees to a re-loadable debit card and skip the hassle of having to deal with direct deposit authorizations or issuing checks as needed.</p> -->

<h6>Smooth Registrations</h6>
<p>When you accept registration payments  online, you not only provide a convenience for those registering, but your team/organization has an accurate report of confirmed registrations and have the information you need to plan accordingly.</p>

<h6>Equipment/Uniform Orders</h6>
<p>Many team sports require teammates to purchase their own equipment and uniforms. Often has been the case where the coach is expected to organize the order,collect the money, write a check to cover the cost of it all - and cross his or her fingers it all works out.  </p>

<p>By allowing these orders to be placed online, you mitigate the headache of asking a coach or sports director to manage the process by streamlining orders, payment, and verification. </p>
